## Nutrient Management

- What has happened with P and N reductions?
- What 
- Did it work?

## Stasis in Northeast

content

## But change at other scales

- VT example
- Other examples?
- What about RI?

## Watershed Watch

- Details on WW program and data collected

## Watershed Watch: filtered for trend analysis

- What we filtered
- resultant datasets details

## LAGOSNE

## Analysis: Site-specific z-scores

## Analysis: Yearly trends

## Results: Nutrient trends

## Results: Chlorophyll trends

## Results: Temperature trends

## Conclusions

### In Rhode Island
- More chlorophyll
- More heat
- Nutrients not changing much

### Within the Northeast
- Stasis (our analysis concurs)
